This code prompts the user for the filename of a .csv file containing contact set data and then returns whether or not the set 
is in form closure. 
The .csv file must be in the same directory as the program to work. 
The .csv file should have 3 columns: x coordinate, y coordinate, contact normal direction (in radians)
Dependencies:
numpy
scipy

This code was run in Python 3.7 but I believe it should run on lower versions of Python 3 as well. 

The image "closed.png" corresponds to the contact set in "closed.csv"
The image "open.png" corresponds to the contact set in "open.csv"
