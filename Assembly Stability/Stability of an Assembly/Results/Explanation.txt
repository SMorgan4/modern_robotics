The vector summation.png file shows graphically that the contact force vectors acting on each of the three bodies (1,3,2) sum to the 
gravitational vector acting on the body. Therefore the solution calculated by the program is valid and the struture is able to stand.

In the case where the assembly collapses no static solution can be found where the normal forces at the contacts are non-negative. 
Therefore, friction is unable to hold the assembly together.
